# EmailSender

An email sender which sends the same email to all recipients, replacing the title with each person's name.

### My motivation

You have a list of names and their corresponding emails, and you want to send each one of them an email with the same content but different  "Dear <THE NAME>". So are you going to edit these emails one by one?

Even worse, you don't have the list. You only have a website with links which will open your email manager when clicked on. So this time, are you clicking every one of them, copying and pasting the content, and editing the title?

I was inspired by my friend when she complained how exhausting the task I described above was.
Exams are hard enough, so your life should be easier.
